I haven't learned how to create a login function that will verify the credentials are correct, so that aspect isn't very functional.
The entire site is very barebones. It was made mostly by modifying the code I'd written following along with the live session.

I added the header navigation bar to all the major pages involving the site's purpose. I didn't know how to create a large text box for
the message field in the contact form, so I found it online through google. I copied and pasted the code from one of the news pages and
modified it for other news pages. I then made sure all the pages were linked correctly in the nav bar and added the footer to all pages.

In this project, I created a very simple website. It has very basic functions.
Its only purpose is to to demonstrate CSS and HTML website creation functionality.
That's all there is to it.

I've tried several ways to authenticate the name and address, then get the javascript output for the salary, but
my if statement wasn't able to authenticate within the form. The lecture and course material, from my understanding,
only explained how to confirm data through the terminal/console, and not in the context of a form like the POST
method and input fields. This is my feedback for the live session 4/13, since I wouldn't have been able to tell at
that time that it wouldn't have prepared me for this project.

The assignment makes it sound like I was intended to create several pages, all linked with javascript and CSS files,
but I wasn't entirely sure if that was expected or if I had leniency on how I approached the assignment. I decided to
get rid of the if statement, because it didn't authenticate anything. There's alerts that pop up when going to both
the front page and payroll, in addition to having a CSS file linked. The salary appears in the console on the payroll
page as well.
