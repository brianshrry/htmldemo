(this is a project for my Simplilearn bootcamp, this readme is the documentation submitted with the rest of the project)

I haven't learned how to create a login function that will verify the credentials are correct, so that aspect isn't very functional. The entire site is very barebones. It was made mostly by modifying the code I'd written following along with the live session.

I added the header navigation bar to all the major pages involving the site's purpose. I didn't know how to create a large text box for the message field in the contact form, so I found it online through google. I copied and pasted the code from one of the news pages and modified it for other news pages. I then made sure all the pages were linked correctly in the nav bar and added the footer to all pages.
